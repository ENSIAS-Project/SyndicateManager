%\textbf{Manifesto for Agile Software Development }\\
%We are uncovering better ways of developing
%software by doing it and helping others do it.
%Through this work we have come to value:
"
\begin{enumerate}
    \item  Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
    \item Working software over comprehensive documentation
    \item Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
    \item Responding to change over following a plan 
\end{enumerate}
"
\cite*{beck2001agile}
%That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.
